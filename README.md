stomel
======

Spatial tools for ocean modeling in python.   

Example
=======

Likely the most notable 
module of stomel is the orthogonal triangular grid generation. A sampling
of its features can be seen in this [ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rustychris/stomel/blob/master/examples/tom_test.ipynb)

Install
======

For Linux/x64, all of the requisite packages are available through binstar.  

In your .condarc, add 

    channels:
      - rustychris
      - public
      - defaults

and in theory you can install everything with

    conda install stomel
  
Similar packages for OSX are underway.  Any help getting this to run on Windows
would be highly appreciated.
